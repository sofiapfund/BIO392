## Genome Analysis Technologies

### Non-Sequence Genomics
1. Cytogenetics (chromosomal analysis - **no** knowdlege about sequence alterations needed)
2. Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH - **indirect** attribution of involved target genes)
3. Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH - **direct** attribution of involved target genes)

### Genome Analysis


### Terminology
BAC = bacterial artificial chromosome

YAC = yeast artificial chromosome
