## Genome Analysis Technologies

### Non-Sequence Genomics
1. Cytogenetics (chromosomal analysis - **no** knowdlege about sequence alterations needed)
2. Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH - **indirect** attribution of involved target genes)
3. Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH - **direct** attribution of involved target genes)

### Genome Analysis
* SNP Genotyping: only look at specific alterations in the genomes

* Whole Exome Sequencing: only look at the part of the genome that contains protein coding genes (exomes)

* Sanger Sequencing vs. NGS 

* Advantage of Nanopore sequencing: can sequence very long reads (**cons**: fidelity not very high: not good to identify new SNPs and for disease diagnostics! **pros**: identify DNA of known composition and for de-novo assembly for telomere/repeat regions)

* sequences like telomeres and centromeres have a lot of repeat and are hard to sequence 

### Genomic File Formats



### Terminology
BAC = bacterial artificial chromosome

YAC = yeast artificial chromosome
