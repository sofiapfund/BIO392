# "The Progenetix oncogenomic resource in 2021" - Reading Notes

Note: use figures

* CNVs are a frequent type of mutation in cancer
* to study mechanisms underlying tumorogenesis and characterize molecular subtypes, comparative analysis of large collections of genomic variants is needed
* Description of Progenetix:
  > Progenetix is a publicly accessible cancer genome data resource (progenetix.org) that aims to provide a comprehensive representation of genomic variation profiles in cancer, through providing sample-specific CNA profiles and associated metadata as well as services related to data annotation, meta-analysis and visualization.
  > Originally established in 2001 with a focus on data from chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) studies (3), the resource has progressively incorporated data from hundreds of publications reporting on genome pro- filing experiments based on molecular cytogenetics (CGH, genomic arrays) and sequencing (whole-genome or whole- exome sequencing—WGS or WES). 
* Data found on Progenetix:
  > For data content, additions include the complete incorporation of the previously separate arrayMap data collection and of datasets from external resources and projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or cBioPortal, as well as the recurrent collection and re-processing of array-based data from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or Euro- pean Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)’s ArrayExpress.



# Questions
* what is CNV/CNA?

CNA stands for *copy number aberrations*, while CNV stands for *copy number variation*. Both of these terms can be used to refer to a frequent type of structural genome variation occurring in cancer. 
This type of mutation has a functional impact in cancer development.

* how will you describe or introduce progenetix? (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)

From the the main page of progenetix website:
> The Progenetix database provides an overview of mutation data in cancer, with a focus on copy number abnormalities (CNV / CNA), for all types of human malignancies. 
> The data is based on individual sample data from currently 142063 samples.

* what are CNV segmentations and CSN frequencies. and how to use them?

* what are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?

* how does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?

* what do you think should be improved in progenetix?
