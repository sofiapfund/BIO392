**Q1 - Which family of mobile elements has the most insertions?**

**Q2 - How many insertions are there in exons? what do we expect?**

**Q3 - How can we quantify those?**

**Q4 - Which family of mobile elements has the most insertions?**

**Q5 - How many insertions are there in exons? what do we expect?**

**Q6 - How can we quantify those?**

Given the low abundance in exons, where do they jump?
Promoters? enhancers? heterochromatin? other repetitive elements?
What can we use as a reference, how do we assign `functions' to all nucleotides in a genome?
